<h1>U MUMBA</h1>
<h2>Owned by Ronnie Screwvala, U Mumba,
 the Mumbai based franchise of the Pro Kabaddi League carved a niche
 for itself in the first season alone as it received a resounding response
 from millions of viewerswho not only followed the team on television but
 also flocked to the stadiums in large numbers.Derived from the word Mumba,
 the name represents the mother island that gave birth to a mega city which
 is now known as Mumbai.

Led by captain, Anup Kumar, coached by Ravi Shetty with Bhaskaran E. 
as the Strategic Adviser, U Mumba consistently maintained its position as
 the front-runner with 11 games which included 8 wins and 3 draws. 
U Mumba claimed the second spot at the season finale after the 
final match against Jaipur Pink Panthers.

U Mumba is already gearing up for a powerful performance and 
is determined to win the PKL title this year. With the goal of 
furthering the sport of Kabaddi, the team’s parent company, 
U Sports is looking at constructing a first of its kind Kabaddi arena.
The company also has an enabler program for young athletes to grow into 
professional Kabaddi players and runs a parallel incubation programme called
 U Mumba Future Stars.
